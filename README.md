# Industrial-Copper-Modeling
The copper industry encounters challenges in lead capture and making optimal pricing decisions. Handling these tasks manually is time-consuming and may not yield the best outcomes.

This project aims to develop machine learning models to address these challenges by predicting lead status and determining selling prices using advanced techniques.

## Pre-Requisite
1) Python: Install Python

## Installation
1) Clone the repo, create and activate the environment for the project.
2) Install all required packages from requirements.txt file using command: "pip install -r requirements.txt"

## Usage
1) Run the notebook "industrial_copper_modelling.ipynb" cells.
2) To start the app, run command: "streamlit run streamlit_ui_prediction_page.py.py".
3) For lead status prediction, in the "Predict Order Status" page, input the required features and click on "Predict Status" button.
4) For selling price prediction, in the "Predict Selling Price" page, input the required features and click on "Predict Selling Price" button.

## Features
1) Setting up Streamlit App: Creating a user-friendly UI using Streamlit for predicting lead status and selling price.
2) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality and preparing it for analysis and model building.
3) Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
4) Model Building and Evaluation: Developing machine learning models to predict lead status and determine optimal selling prices, and evaluating their performance.
5) Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance by fine-tuning model parameters for better predictions.
